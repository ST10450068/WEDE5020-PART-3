Before receiving a laptop from EmpowerEd, I struggled to keep up with my assignments, especially when everything shifted online. I didn’t have consistent access to a computer, which made it difficult to do research, complete homework, or participate in online classes. EmpowerEd changed that. Not only did they provide me with a laptop, but they also offered tutoring and academic support that helped me stay on track. Thanks to their help, I was able to improve my grades and develop skills I never thought I’d master. I’m so grateful for their support—it made all the difference in my education and future prospects." – Sarah, Student</p>
